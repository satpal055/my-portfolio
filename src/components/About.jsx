                    I’m Satpal Singh, a Front-End Developer with a solid foundation in UI/UX design and over four years of experience building clean, responsive, and user-focused interfaces.
                    I started my career as a Web Designer, working extensively with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,Wordpress ,  Photoshop, and Tailwind CSS, creating modern layouts, landing pages, and visually engaging designs.
                    Today, I combine this design expertise with React.js, JavaScript, and component-based architecture to build fast, scalable, and high-performing web applications.
                    My focus is always on delivering digital experiences that balance clean design, smooth usability, and modern development practices.
